            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
              Our research interests lie in the intersection of life and natural
              sciences with signal and image processing. These vary from
              developing new algorithms for the analysis of data arising from a
              variety of imaging modalities to the use of DNA molecules for
              storing and processing digital signals.

              topics the lab has been working on. We would like to <a href="Acknowledgements.html">acknowledge</a>

            <h3>Cardiac MRI</h3>
            <p>
              Computers and image analysis have been used in the past to assist
              in analyzing a variety of cardiac MR studies. We have been working
              exclusively with cardiac BOLD data, that not only provide
              functional information (e.g., how the heart moves) but also
              physiological (e.g., if the heart gets enough blood). This unique
              synergy of new sequence development (CP-BOLD) and analysis not
              only improves diagnostic outcome but also provides a quantitative
              way towards designing MR sequences to improve the quality of MR
              imaging. We have developed image analysis methods (segmentation,
              tracking) and have applied them to prove a variety of unique
              hypothesis in BOLD cardiac MRI.
            </p>
            <h3>Phenotyping</h3>
            <p>
              Due to our strong experience in the medical research and clinical
              field we approach several clinical and science problems from a
              unique perspective. We are actively involved in the research areas
              of brain imaging and cardiac imaging, centering our efforts in MRI
              imaging. We combine advanced algorithmic routines to extract
              biomarker information from images and identify unique
              characteristics, phenotypes, and topology. We are particularly
              active in data driven approaches (data mining) where new
              phenotypes and structures are discovered without posing formal
              hypotheses. Central to our research is the use of network theory
              in developing novel representations of complex data. We work with
              various <a href="http://prian.lab.imtlucca.it/PROJECTS/PHIDIAS/phidias.html">plant</a>
              and animal model organisms and always aim to rapidly translate our
              findings to the clinical arena.

            <h3>Artifact removal and restoration for imaging at the cellular or
              molecular level</h3>
            <p>
              We have developed algorithms for the restoration of distortions in
              Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging and denoising of microarray
              images with non-parametric statistical models. To remove the
              curvature distortion in AFM images of DNA encapsulated carbon
              nanotubes we developed a new method that iteratively estimates the
              distortion and segments the objects of interest. For microarray
              imaging, we developed a method that estimates the intensity of
              microarray spots and removes global and local noise and
              illumination differences purely using statistical data reduction
              methods (EigenSpots).
            </p>
            <h3>DNA Inspired Signal Processing</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of this research is to consider possibilities of doing
              Digital Signal Processing (DSP) outside the semiconductor or
              electronic domain. Organic elements (such as DNA, polymers) that
              conduct electricity can be used to built organic semiconductors at
              the molecular level, However, more fundamental questions can be
              asked. Can DSP be performed in exotic materials, such as chemical
              substrates, cells, organisms, or even DNA, without the use of
              electrical currents? Will we be able to built fully blown DSP
              systems out of these materials? Or will some DSP functions (such
              as storage and data archiving) be implemented with such materials?
              We have shown (theoretically, numerically, and experimentally)
              that DNA can be used to develop efficient databases of digital
              signals. We have also shown that new biotechnology methods can be
              developed by taking advantage of the computing power of DNA, what
              is also known as smart DNA. The potential towards a non digital
              future of DSP was discussed in an <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/%7Estsaft/#%5B%5B06.%20The%20Not%20So%20Digital%20Future%20of%20Digital%20Signal%20Processing%5D%5D">opinion
                article</a> in The Proceedings of IEEE (the most prestigious
              engineering journal.)
            </p>
            <h3>Application Aware Media Compression</h3>
            <p>
              Can we compress video better if we know that an algorithm is going
              to “see” and analyze the video? The answer is yes. We developed an
              extension of the H.264 video compression standard for the
              compression and transmission of transportation video surveillance.
              The extension maintains low computational requirements and is able
              to achieve up to an 80% reduction in bitrate while maintaining the
              same performance, as measured by the accuracy of tracking
              automatically vehicles in video for driver behavior analysis. We
              have also shown that such reduction can enable the use of wireless
              links that increases the deployability of monitoring sensors,
              increasing the domain of applications that can be addressed (e.g.,
              human movement, marine, aerospace, etc). Even when channel losses
              are concerned, we have developed forward error correction and
              concealment strategies that perform optimally in an application
              aware fashion. We are currently extending this paradigm to
              application aware image compression for phenotyping applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Driver Behavioral Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Can computers predict if car drivers behave normally compared to
              others? Using video tracking and vehicle trajectory data mining we
              can identify statistically in an unsupervised fashion common
              patterns (normal) and uncommon ones (anomalous). We can detect
              these anomalies considering independent trajectory information,
              topological information (e.g., an intersection, a traffic light)
              or even consider interactions among vehicles to identify anomalies
              that occur as consequence of another anomaly. </p>
            <h3>Digital Media Copyright Protection and Transmission</h3>
            <p>
              We have developed a multitude of methods for the protection of
              copyright in digital multimedia. We have developed methods in
              watermarking of digital media, the use of data hiding methods for
              transmission error protection, and using signature extraction for
              video copy detection in databases.
            </p>
            <h3>Imaging for cultural heritage preservation</h3>
            <p>
              We have developed methods for the colorization, registration, and
              correction of illumination of archival photos of monumental works
              by Matisse and Picasso. By combining novel imaging techniques and
              modalities with advanced computational methods for analysis,
              visualization, and interaction we hope to provide the conservation
              and curation arenas with new and unique tools. Our work was
              illustrated in the cover of the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753066">May
                2011 issue of the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</a>.
